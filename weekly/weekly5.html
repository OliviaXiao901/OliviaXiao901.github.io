    <h3> Do you agree with foucault that your own life is shaped through these systems of control? Explain.
How does the Panopticon play out in our contemporary lives?
 </h3>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">According to the ideas of Foucault, people all live in a social prison where
       we are all shaped to a &quotgood&quot citizen to meet the needs of the people in power. In fact, average citizens
       in the society are all sacrificing themselves in a way of tax or service for the protection from the people
       in power. And the penal system is built for maintaining the power structure in the society instead of protecting
       justice or fairness. In the modern world, the system consists of three parts: surveillance, normalization
       and examination.
</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">Just as the design of panopticon where prisoners cannot see the guards and do not
      know when they are watched, people in the modern world are supervised and controlled unconsciously. The prison
      is more about controlling minds instead of physical punishment. For example, in a company, the employer always
      supervise their employees by setting deadlines, monitors and cameras, which is surveillance. Apart from this,
       employers keep on normalizing the standard of a &quotgood employee&quot which creates a competitive environment for employees
       and urges them to work in a professional way for the sake of the management and productivity. And finally, employers
       have a scoring system which acts as an examination to assess the performance and productivity of employees. In this way,
       people are unconsciously controlled and shaped by their employers who are the people in power in the company. This model
       can be used in any other circumstances according to Foucault.
</p>
       <p> From my perspective, since the penal system is not controlled by only a few people, it is unfair to say we are
         controlled by the people in power. When we do the service to the society and we get the protection from the penal
         system through laws, this is a representation of fairness itself. Though the fairness is work for preserving the order
         in the society, the order is actually beneficial for most people so we cannot say the penal system is only built for
         people in power. Since the harmony works for the whole community, though its original goal might be for maintaining the
         social structure, whether the fairness exists or not may not be so important for average citizens.
