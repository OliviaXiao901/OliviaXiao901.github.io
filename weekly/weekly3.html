    <h3> How is materiality manifested in poor images? </h3>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">As a copy in motion, the poor image is &quota ghost of an image, a preview,
      a thumbnail, an errant idea, an itinerant image distributed for free, squeezed through slow digital
       connections, compressed, reproduced, ripped, remixed, as well as copied and pasted into other channels
       of distribution&quot. Though a high-resolution image looks more impressive and mimetic, the value of poor
       image can go far beyond the meaning of image itself. </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">The visuality of the poor image is resolutely compromised, which means that
      it is blurred and amateurish, so it actually create a space for viewers to participate in the creation
      of the image meaning. As the users actively re-edit and distribute the originally poor image, people
      can become editors, critics, translators and co-authors of poor images. Each new edition of the poor
      image reflects the personal thoughts of co-authors, which is a &quotsnapshot of the affective condition of the
      crowd&quot. When the image goes beyond the reality presenting through the image and illustrate a new level of
       reality which conveys the crowd neurosis, paranoia and fear, the materiality does not diminish with
       decrease of the resolution but manifests through the ambiguity. </p>
       <p> In this way, the poor image, in fact, &quotconstructs anonymous global networks just as
         it creates a shared history&quot. Since people distribute the poor images after they do their
         reedition, the circulation of poor images create a &quotvisual bonds&quot. When people share
         their emotions and ideas through the poor image, the empathy between people gradually generates a
         new space to understand and present the materiality, which can expand to different perspectives. That is
         how the poor image not just reflect the materiality but manifest it.
