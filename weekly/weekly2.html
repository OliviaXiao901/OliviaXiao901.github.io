    <h3> How was the internet shaped by Objectivism?
      What is Californian Ideology </h3>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">According to the philosophy of Ayn Rand, &quotthe concept of man
      as a heroic being, with his happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive
      achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.&quot She advocates
      that the government should set people free and give less control to the market. This idea
      can be presented through the internet. </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">One thing that impresses me is how this Objectivism idea connects
      people without controlling their behaviors. Just as the video shows, when people are playing
      video games together, though they are free to act, they all have the same goal which is to win
      the game. That is why their behaviors are united with little disagreements. This idea reflects
      what the internet world looks like in the modern world. Though we do not have a clear rule in
      the internet world, since we share the same morality, the rule then is gradually being formed. </p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">Californian ideology refers to a kind of freedom which let individuals
      do their things and choose on their own. This ideology seems to be an extension of Ayn Rand
      philosophy and computer utopia. Liberating individuals also has a political meaning which means
      less restriction to personal freedom. But the ideology is based on a conform morality shared
       by people, which means that less control may still lead to social problems if the moral line is
       blurred. </p>
