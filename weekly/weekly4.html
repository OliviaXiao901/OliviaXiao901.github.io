    <h3> Do you think humans can be understood through cybernetics?
 </h3>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">As the scientific study of how humans, animals and machines control and communicate with each other, cybernetics includes the study of feedback, black boxes and derived concepts such as communication and control in living organisms, machines and organizations including self-organization. The essential goal of cybernetics is to understand and define the functions and processes of systems that have goals and that participate in circular, causal chains that move from action to sensing to comparison with desired goal, and again to action. As humans are also a part of the system, the feedback of humans can also be predicted through the&quotfeedback loop&quot.
</p>
    <p style="font-size:18px;">From my perspective, humans can be understood through cybernetics. Since decision or behavior of humans is easy to be predicted and there is also a certain rule of human nature, through careful calculation of cybernetics, humans, as a living organism, may be able to be analysed scientifically.
</p>
       <p> But unlike a simple organism, the human is more complicated to think and value. It may be possible to evaluate the rational side of human but it may not be easy to predict the emotional side of human nature. Though the world is becoming more and more difficult to understand with the development of technology, I still believe in the power of humans more than the power of technology or machine. Just like Artificial Intelligence, though it can be used in many fields, some roles of humans are still unable to be replaced, because the behavior of humans is far more complex than we think.
